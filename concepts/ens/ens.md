# ENS supported TLDs

Ethereum Name Service will soon support most TLDs that have DNSSEC enabled.  The necessary DNSSEC algorithms are:
* RSASHA256 (recommended)
* RSASHA1
* P257SHA256 (less good, but still works)

To see the full list, see [TLD DNSSEC Report](http://stats.research.icann.org/dns/tld_report/).

The ccTLDs that currently don't support the required DNSSEC are:
* **ae, ai, al, ao, aq, as, ba, bb, bd, bf, bi, bj, bh, bn, bo, bs, bv, cd, cf, cg, ci, ck, cm, cu, cv, cw, cy, dj, dm, do, ec, eg, er, et, fj, fk, fm, ga, gb, ge, gf, gg, gh, gm, gp, gq, gt, gu, hm, ht, im, iq, ir, je, jm, jo, kh, km, kn, kp, kz, ls, ly, mg, mh, mk, ml, mo, mp, mq, mr, ms, mt, mu, mv, mw, mz, nc, ng, ni, np, nr, om, pa, pf, pg, ph, pk, pn, ps, py, qa, rw, sd, sm, so, sr, st, sv, sy, sz, tc, td, tg, tj, tk, to, tr, uz, va, vg, vi, ye, zm, zw.**
