<!-- TITLE: Programming Languages Intro -->


Smart contracts are [[High-level programming language|high-level]] programming [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstractions]] that are compiled down to EVM [[bytecode]] and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain for execution. They can be written in [[Solidity]] (a language library with similarities to [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[JavaScript]]), Serpent (similar to [[Python (programming language)|Python]]), LLL (a [[Low-level programming language|low-level]] [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]-like language),<ref>{{cite web|title=An Introduction to LLL for Ethereum Smart Contract Development|url=https://media.consensys.net/an-introduction-to-lll-for-ethereum-smart-contract-development-e26e38ea6c23|website=Medium|accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=LLL compiler code|url=https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/lllc|website=Github|accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ethereum solidity repository|url=https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/tree/develop/liblll|website=Github|accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref> and Mutan ([[Go (programming language)|Go]]-based, but deprecated<ref>{{cite web|title=Jeffrey Wilcke's Mutan repository|url=https://github.com/obscuren/mutan|website=Github|accessdate=7 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Tual|first1=Stephan|title=Mutan FAQ|url=https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/922/mutan-faq|website=Ethereum Community Forum|accessdate=7 January 2018}}</ref>). There is also an experimental secure smart contract language under development called Vyper (a [[Strong and weak typing|strongly-typed]] [[Python (programming language)|Python]]-derived [[Recursive language|decidable language]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Ethereum Vyper Github repository|url=https://github.com/ethereum/Vyper|website=Github|accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref><ref name="ETHNviper">{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnews.com/geth-viper-and-wafr-new-ethereum-developments|last=Rivlin|first=Brianne|date=14 November 2016|title=Geth, Viper, and Wafr: New Ethereum Developments|publisher=ETHNews|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904151349/https://www.ethnews.com/geth-viper-and-wafr-new-ethereum-developments|archivedate=4 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There is also JULIA,<ref>{{cite web|title=JULIA|url=https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/julia.html|website=Solidity Read the Docs|accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref> an intermediate language for different Ethereum virtual machines. 

Solidity is the most supported and maintained language as of January 6 2018. Solidity has 9171 commits as of Jan 7 2018, with the last commits on Jan 6 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ethereum Solidity repository|url=https://github.com/ethereum/solidity|website=Github|accessdate=7 January 2018}}</ref>. Serpent has 416 commits as of Jan 7 2018,<ref>{{cite web|title=Ethereum Serpent repository|url=https://github.com/ethereum/serpent|website=Github|accessdate=7 January 2018}}</ref> and was last updated on 1 Oct 2017, as of Jan 7 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Commits to the Ethereum Serpent repository|url=https://github.com/ethereum/serpent/commits/develop|website=Github|accessdate=7 January 2018}}</ref>. LLL doesn't have a dedicated repository, but there are three pages of commits, 10 files, (4 + 662 + 54 + 114 + 31 + 78 + 46 + 37 + 136 + 33 = 1195 sloc) in a liblll folder in the Solidity repository, with the last update on 15 Jun 2017, as of Jan 7 2017;<ref>{{cite web|title=liblll folder in the Solidity repo|url=https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commits/develop?before=2548228b365d56612e2f039f735be0fdf6ce0807+70&path%5B%5D=liblll|website=Github|accessdate=7 January 2018}}</ref> and there is one page of commits and 159 lines of code in an lllc folder in the Solidity repo,<ref>{{cite web|title=LLLC folder in Solidity|url=https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/commits/develop/lllc|website=Github|accessdate=7 January 2018}}</ref> (as of Jan 7 2017).
